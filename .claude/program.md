# Program

## Instructions

<!-- BRD INSTRUCTIONS PLACEHOLDER -->
<!-- Replace this block with the Business Requirements Document (BRD) instructions for the current project. -->
<!-- These instructions drive the autonomous /auto loop — be specific about features, acceptance criteria, and constraints. -->

## Constraints

- **Layered architecture:** All code must respect the layer hierarchy defined in `architecture.md`. No cross-layer imports in forbidden directions.
- **Review gate:** Every sprint/iteration must pass the review gate before advancing to the next phase.
- **Max retries:** No more than 3 consecutive auto-fix attempts per error category before escalating to a human.
- **No new dependencies without noting:** Any new package or library added must be logged in the current iteration's status block.
- **Self-heal before revert:** Always attempt automated self-healing (see Self-Healing Policy) before reverting to a prior commit.
- **Never delete learned rules:** Rules discovered during a session (error patterns, project-specific fixes) must be preserved in memory and never removed.
- **TDD mandatory:** Write failing tests FIRST, then implement code to make them pass. Never write implementation before tests. Tests define the contract; code fulfills it.
- **100% meaningful coverage:** Every line of generated code must be covered by tests. Coverage is not about bug prevention — it's about guaranteeing the agent has double-checked the behavior of every line it wrote (ref: "AI is forcing us to write good code" by Steve Krenzel). At 100%, any uncovered line is an immediate, unambiguous signal of missing verification.
- **Coverage floor: 80%.** The ratchet gate BLOCKS any commit that drops coverage below 80%. Target is 100% — 80% is the absolute minimum, not the goal.
- **Model tiering:** Use Opus for orchestration/evaluation (judgment tasks), Sonnet for implementation teammates (execution tasks). Configure via project-manifest.json.

## Stopping Criteria

The autonomous `/auto` loop terminates when any of the following conditions are met:

| Condition | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| All features pass | Every story in the current sprint has passing tests and a green review gate |
| 3 consecutive failures | The same error category fails 3 times in a row without progress |
| Architecture violation | A layer dependency violation is detected and cannot be auto-fixed |
| Coverage below threshold | Test coverage drops below the project baseline and cannot be recovered in one iteration |
| Max iterations | The configured maximum iteration count is reached (default: 50, configured in project-manifest.json) |

## Self-Healing Policy

When an automated check fails, apply the fix strategy from the table below before re-running. If the fix strategy fails after the max retry count, stop and report.

| Category | Signal | Auto-fix |
|----------|--------|----------|
| Lint/format | ruff/eslint fails | `ruff check --fix && ruff format` |
| Type error | mypy/tsc reports type errors | Fix annotation or cast at the error site |
| Test failure | pytest/vitest fails | Fix code under test; never modify the test to make it pass |
| Import error | `ImportError` / `ModuleNotFoundError` at runtime | Fix layer placement or missing `__init__` |
| Coverage drop | Coverage falls below baseline | Add targeted tests for uncovered lines |
| API check fail | Evaluator returns 500/404 or wrong response schema | Read error message, fix service logic or router handler |
| Playwright fail | Element not found / wrong state in browser test | Read selector, fix component rendering or interaction |
| Design score low | Critic scores UI below threshold | Apply critique feedback, regenerate affected component |
| Docker fail | Container fails to start or health check fails | Read container logs, fix config or dependency issue |
| Architecture drift | Response shape does not match declared schema | Read schema definition, fix response serialization |

## Pipeline Status

Phase order is owned by `/build` (`.claude/skills/build/SKILL.md`): Brownfield discovery (existing codebases) → BRD → Spec → Design + Test-planning (parallel) → state init → deploy artifacts (docker mode) → autonomous execution via `/auto` (ratchet loop) → E2E test generation → README. Do not sequence phases from this file.

| Phase | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Brownfield discovery | pending | existing codebases only |
| BRD | pending | Business requirements not yet loaded |
| Spec | pending | |
| Design + Test-plan | pending | run in parallel |
| Deploy artifacts | pending | docker mode |
| Autonomous execution (/auto) | pending | |
| E2E test generation | pending | |
| README | pending | |
