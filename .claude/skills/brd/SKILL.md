# BRD Skill — Business Requirements Document

## Usage

```
/brd                              # interview-from-scratch
/brd --frd path/to/frd.md         # ground the BRD in a Functional Requirements Document
/brd --prd path/to/prd.md         # alias for --frd: a PRD is the grounding baseline
/brd --delta path/to/prd-sprintN.md    # ground sprint N's PRD against the prior sprint's requirement spine
```

Two modes:
- **Document-grounded (recommended for greenfield):** pass `--frd <path>` (or its alias `--prd <path>`) to a Functional/Product Requirements Document. `--prd` and `--frd` are treated identically — the document becomes the immutable grounding baseline, extracted into the same requirements spine (`frd-requirements.json`); only the input flag name differs. For the canonical PRD shape this skill grounds best against, see `docs/prd-format.md`. The document becomes the immutable grounding baseline — Claude interrogates it for gaps, then generates a BRD in which **every requirement traces back to a source section or to a confirmed clarification.** A deterministic gate (Step 4.4) hard-blocks anything invented or dropped relative to the source before you ever see it for approval.
- **Interview-from-scratch:** no argument — an interactive Socratic interview gathers requirements from nothing. Use only when there is no source document.

---

## Overview

This is the first gate in the SDLC pipeline, and the origin of the whole grounding chain (`BRD → /spec → /design → /test → /auto`). Mistakes here cascade through every downstream phase, so the BRD must invent nothing the business did not state. With `--frd`, the FRD plus the human's confirmed interrogation answers are the **only** sanctioned sources of content; with no FRD, the confirmed interview answers are. Either way the planner interviews the human across five dimensions to surface the full problem space — Socratic: ask clarifying questions, probe assumptions, reflect answers back for confirmation before moving on.

---

## Delta Mode (`--delta`)

> Invoked by `/sprint` for sprint N (N >= 2). Grounds a new PRD against the
> **prior sprint's approved requirement spine**, not against nothing — this is
> what proves the new PRD's requirements are new/changed/carried, and flags
> anything it silently drops. See
> `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-04-sprint-delta-lane-design.md`.

### Step Δ0 — Locate the prior spine and resolve N

List `specs/brd/sprint-*/` directories; let `prev` be the highest number found.
If none exist, the prior spine is the flat legacy `specs/brd/brd-requirements.json`
(sprint 1 predates sprint-numbered directories) and `N = 2`. If sprint
directories exist, `N = prev + 1`. If neither the flat file nor any sprint
directory exists, halt — `--delta` requires a prior sprint; use `--frd`/`--prd`
for the very first sprint.

### Step Δ1 — Run Steps 0.0 through 4 unchanged, writing to `specs/brd/sprint-N/`

Run the FRD-grounded flow (Steps 0.0, 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 2.8, 3, 4) exactly as
written above, with one change: every output path becomes
`specs/brd/sprint-N/` (e.g. `specs/brd/sprint-N/brd.md`,
`specs/brd/sprint-N/brd-requirements.json`, `specs/brd/sprint-N/clarification-log.json`).
When writing `brd-requirements.json`, any requirement that carries forward a
prior-sprint requirement unchanged (or with only minor edits) must include
that prior sprint's BR id in its `traces` array alongside this sprint's own
FRD/clarification traces — this is what lets Step Δ2's classification tell
"carried forward" apart from "silently dropped."

### Step Δ2 — Requirements-delta classification [HARD BLOCK]

Step 4.4's grounding gate still runs unchanged (this sprint's BRD vs this
sprint's own FRD/PRD spine). In addition, classify this sprint's spine against
the **prior sprint's** spine — the same `trace-check.js` engine, reused with
the prior spine as `required`, this sprint's spine also as a valid trace
target (`optional`), and this sprint's spine as `downstream`:

```bash
node .claude/scripts/trace-check.js \
  --required specs/brd/sprint-{prev}/brd-requirements.json \
  --optional specs/brd/sprint-N/brd-requirements.json \
  --downstream specs/brd/sprint-N/brd-requirements.json \
  --layer requirements-delta \
  --out specs/brd/sprint-N/requirements-delta.json
```

(When `prev` refers to the flat legacy layout, use `--required specs/brd/brd-requirements.json`.)

Read the resulting `requirements-delta.json`:
- `net_new` entries are genuinely new requirements this sprint introduces — expected, not a failure.
- `dropped` entries are prior-sprint requirements this sprint's spine does not cover — **each one needs an explicit human decision**: still active (add a BR entry carrying it forward) or intentionally retired (record why in this sprint's BRD Open Questions). A `dropped` entry with no such resolution is a silent regression — halt and ask before proceeding to Step 4.5.

**Empty-spine guard:** a `required_total: 0` here means the prior sprint's
spine is empty — a pre-spine legacy project. Skip this step in that case and
note it in the BRD summary (Step 4.4's own grounding gate still runs
normally against this sprint's spine).

### Step Δ3 — Present for Human Approval (delta mode)

Same as Step 5, plus display the requirements-delta classification (new /
changed / carried / dropped, with the human's resolution for each dropped
item) before asking for approval.

---

## Steps

### Step 0.0 — Ingest the FRD (only when `--frd <path>` was given)

If an FRD path was provided:

1. **Copy it verbatim** to `specs/brd/source-frd.md` — this is the immutable grounding baseline. Never edit it.
2. **Extract its requirements** into `specs/brd/frd-requirements.json` — one entry per discrete functional requirement, with a stable id, the requirement text, and the source section:
   ```json
   [
     { "id": "FRD-1", "text": "Users can reset their password via an emailed link", "section": "3.2 Authentication" },
     { "id": "FRD-2", "text": "Users can view their order history", "section": "4.1 Orders" }
   ]
   ```
   Be exhaustive and faithful — every "the system must / shall / should" statement, every user-facing behavior, every business rule becomes one `FRD-n`. Do not paraphrase away constraints. This list is what the BRD will be checked against, so a requirement you fail to extract here is a requirement that can be silently dropped.

If no `--frd` was given, skip this step; the BRD's grounding baseline is then the confirmed `INT-n` interview requirements captured in Step 2 (`specs/brd/interview-requirements.json`), plus the Step 0.5 clarification log.

### Step 0 — Brainstorm with Superpowers

Before beginning the interview, invoke `superpowers:brainstorming` to explore the user's intent, requirements, and design space. This surfaces hidden assumptions and alternative framings before the structured Socratic interview locks in a direction. In FRD-grounded mode, brainstorm **gaps and ambiguities in the FRD** specifically — what it leaves unspecified. The brainstorming output feeds into the interview — it does not replace it.

### Step 0.5 — Apply the Clarification Budget (and log every answer)

Before asking interview questions, invoke `.claude/skills/clarify/SKILL.md`. Use it to cap the total clarification burden:
- Ask only load-bearing questions that affect requirements, scope, data, security, architecture, or story readiness.
- Default to 10 total questions across the BRD interview.
- Continue to 15 only if the user explicitly asks to keep going.
- Capture low-risk assumptions in the BRD instead of asking about them.

**Persist every confirmed answer to `specs/brd/clarification-log.json`** with a stable id:
```json
[
  { "id": "C1", "question": "What is the password-reset token TTL?", "answer": "1 hour" },
  { "id": "C2", "question": "Should order history paginate?", "answer": "Yes, 20 per page" }
]
```
The clarification log is the **only** sanctioned channel for content not already in the FRD. A BRD requirement may legitimately introduce something new *only* if it traces to an FRD section, an `INT-n` interview requirement, or a `C-n` clarification here — so anything the human confirms that expands scope must be captured as a `C-n` entry, not absorbed silently into the BRD prose.

### Step 1 — Analyze Existing Codebase (if any)

Before beginning the interview, scan the working directory for existing code. Note:
- Current tech stack, frameworks, languages
- Existing data models or schemas
- Existing API surface
- Any patterns or conventions already in use

If this is an existing non-trivial codebase and `specs/brownfield/codebase-map.md` does not exist, recommend running `/brownfield` first. For small or urgent work, continue only after documenting the risk and the limited scope.

This prevents proposing solutions that conflict with what is already built.

### Step 2 — Conduct the Five-Dimension Interview

Work through each dimension in order. Do not skip dimensions. Ask only the highest-value questions within the clarification budget, then summarize what you heard and ask the human to confirm before proceeding. If a dimension is already answered by local context, document the assumption and move on.

**As each dimension is confirmed, append the confirmed requirement statements to `specs/brd/interview-requirements.json`** — one entry per discrete requirement the human signed off:

```json
[{ "id": "INT-1", "text": "Admins invite users by email", "section": "users-and-permissions" }]
```

Write entries **at confirmation time, not after synthesis** — this file is the grounding baseline the BRD is mechanically checked against (Step 4.4), so it must capture what the human confirmed before BRD prose can drift. Q&A detail that is context rather than a requirement stays in `clarification-log.json` (`C-n`); a statement the human confirmed as something the system must do is an `INT-n`.

---

#### Dimension 1 — Why (Problem & Goals)

- What problem does this solve, and for whom?
- Who are the target users (role, technical level, context of use)?
- What does success look like in 90 days? What metrics will you track?
- What is the cost of not solving this problem?

Confirm: "Here is what I understand the problem and goals to be: [summary]. Is this correct?"

---

#### Dimension 2 — What (Scope & MVP)

- What are the core operations this system must perform? (List them.)
- What is explicitly out of scope for the first version?
- What is the minimum viable product — the smallest slice that delivers real value?
- Are there existing tools or systems this must integrate with?

Confirm: "Here is the core scope and MVP as I understand it: [summary]. Anything to add or change?"

---

#### Dimension 2.5 — Alternatives (Implementation Approaches)

Propose 2-3 concrete implementation approaches with trade-offs. For each option:
- Brief description of the approach
- Key advantages
- Key disadvantages / risks
- Best suited for (what context)

Ask the human to choose an approach or blend aspects. Document the chosen direction and the rationale for rejecting alternatives.

---

#### Dimension 3 — How (Technical Architecture)

- What is the preferred tech stack, or are there constraints (language, cloud, existing infra)?
- How will data be stored? What are the main data entities?
- Are there external integrations, APIs, or third-party services involved?
- What are the performance or scalability requirements?

Confirm: "Here is the technical direction I am capturing: [summary]. Does this match your expectations?"

---

#### Dimension 4 — Edge Cases (Failure & Constraints)

- What happens when [key operation] fails? Who is notified, and how?
- What are the operational constraints (uptime requirements, rate limits, budget)?
- Does this system handle sensitive data (PII, financial, health)? What compliance applies?
- What are the most likely failure modes in the first 6 months?

Confirm: "Here are the constraints and failure scenarios I am recording: [summary]. Anything missing?"

---

#### Dimension 5 — UI Context (Interface & Design)

- Is there a UI? If so, what are the primary screens or flows?
- Are there design references, mockups, or brand guidelines to follow?
- What devices and viewports must be supported (desktop, tablet, mobile)?
- Are there accessibility requirements (WCAG level)?

Confirm: "Here is the UI context I have captured: [summary]. Is this complete?"

---

### Step 2.7 — Seed Domain Vocabulary from Enabled Vertical Plugins

**Run the vertical glossary pack script.** Run `node .claude/scripts/vertical-glossary-pack.js`. This is a no-op (nothing written, nothing to do here) unless `.claude/config/scaffold-packs.json`'s `verticalPacks` array has at least one entry whose `enabled_plugin_prefix` matches a truthy key in `.claude/settings.json#enabledPlugins`.

- **Pack(s) written.** For each `specs/brd/<plugin>-glossary-pack.json` the script wrote, read it. For each context entry, distill the real domain nouns implied by each skill's description into `CONTEXT.md`'s `## Terms` section (create `CONTEXT.md` from `.claude/templates/context.template.md` first if it does not exist yet). Use the context's `name` as a **`<Bounded Context Name>`** bold grouping line (not a `###` heading — `vocabulary-check.js` parses every `###` under `## Terms` as a glossary term, so only actual terms may use that heading level), with individual `### <Term>` entries and a one-line definition beneath each.
- **Broken plugin install.** If the script exited 2, at least one enabled vertical's skills directory was missing or empty. Note the broken plugin install(s) in the progress log and continue — packs from any OTHER, successfully-resolved vertical were still written and should still be distilled per the bullet above. Do not block the BRD on a broken install.
- **No verticals enabled.** If the script reported nothing enabled and wrote no pack files, no registered vertical plugin is active for this project — do nothing further.

**Layering with Step 2.8.** Step 2.8 below still runs afterward for every project and merges `domain_concepts`-derived terms into the same `CONTEXT.md`, layering project-specific concepts on top of any vertical baseline(s) rather than overwriting them.

---

### Step 2.8 — Write the BRD Analysis Pack

Before synthesizing the BRD prose, write `specs/brd/brd-analysis.json`. This is the SPDD-inspired analysis layer that turns the PRD/interview into a design contract instead of a thin summary. It must be grounded in the FRD/PRD, the clarification log, and existing-code scan.

The JSON must include:

```json
{
  "domain_concepts": [
    { "name": "Subscription Plan", "status": "existing|new", "evidence": "FRD-1 or specs/brownfield/code-graph.json node", "notes": "business meaning and nearby terms" }
  ],
  "ambiguity_table": [
    { "id": "AMB-1", "question": "What remains ambiguous?", "default_assumption": "Chosen assumption", "risk_if_wrong": "Concrete consequence", "resolution": "clarified|assumed|deferred", "trace": ["FRD-1", "C1"] }
  ],
  "edge_case_table": [
    { "id": "EDGE-1", "scenario": "Boundary/failure case", "expected_behaviour": "Observable result", "trace": ["FRD-1"] }
  ],
  "decision_log": [
    { "id": "DEC-1", "decision": "Chosen direction", "alternatives_rejected": ["Alternative A"], "rationale": "Trade-off that decided it", "trace": ["C2"] }
  ],
  "ac_coverage_matrix": [
    { "requirement_id": "FRD-1", "acceptance_criteria": ["AC-1"], "covered": true, "gap": "" }
  ],
  "risk_gap_table": [
    { "id": "RISK-1", "risk": "What could derail this", "mitigation": "Harness or design response", "owner": "human|agent|deferred", "trace": ["FRD-2"] }
  ]
}
```

Rules:
- **Domain Concepts** marks each important business object as `existing` or `new`. In brownfield mode, `existing` entries cite a code-graph node or file path; in greenfield, they cite FRD/PRD sections or `INT-n` interview requirements.
- **Ambiguity Table** captures load-bearing uncertainties that were clarified, assumed, or deferred. A deferred ambiguity must appear in the BRD Open Questions.
- **Edge-Case Table** names failures, limits, empty states, concurrency/race cases, and security/privacy exceptions that the BRD must preserve downstream.
- **AC Coverage Matrix** proves every extracted FRD/PRD/`INT-n` requirement has at least one observable acceptance criterion before the grounding gate runs.
- **Risk & Gap Table** records risks and missing inputs without turning them into hidden implementation scope.

**Seed the domain glossary.** After writing `domain_concepts`, create or update `CONTEXT.md` at the repo root from it: for each entry, add or update a `### <name>` heading under `## Terms` using `notes` as the definition (use the template at `.claude/templates/context.template.md` if `CONTEXT.md` does not exist yet). Do this for greenfield BRDs too — `CONTEXT.md` must exist after this step whenever `domain_concepts` is non-empty, which it always is. If `/brownfield` already created `CONTEXT.md`, merge into it rather than overwriting existing terms.

If this pack exposes a dropped requirement, unresolved high-risk ambiguity, or uncovered acceptance criterion, fix the interview/clarification log before proceeding. Do not paper over it in the BRD.

### Step 3 — Synthesize into BRD

After all five dimensions are confirmed, produce a structured BRD with these sections:

1. Executive Summary
2. Problem Statement
3. Target Users
4. Success Metrics
5. Scope (In / Out)
6. MVP Definition
7. Alternatives Considered (with rationale for chosen approach)
8. Technical Architecture
9. Data Model Overview
10. External Integrations
11. Edge Cases & Constraints
12. UI Context
13. Open Questions
14. BRD Analysis Summary — summarize the Domain Concepts, Ambiguity Table, Edge-Case Table, AC Coverage Matrix, and Risk & Gap Table from `brd-analysis.json`; keep the full detail in JSON.
15. Forbidden Actions — an explicit list of things the implementation must **not** do, derived from the Out-of-Scope items (Dimension 2) and any source "non-goals". This becomes the deny-list the downstream gate (and any autonomous merge) enforces; phrase each as a checkable prohibition (e.g. "must not call external payment APIs", "must not store raw passwords").

### Step 4 — Write to `specs/brd/`

- For a new project: write to `specs/brd/brd.md`
- For a feature addition: write to `specs/brd/feature-{name}.md`

Also write the **machine-readable requirement spine** to `specs/brd/brd-requirements.json` — one entry per BRD requirement, each with a stable id and a `traces` array citing the FRD section ids and/or `C-n` clarification ids it derives from:
```json
[
  { "id": "BR-1", "text": "Password reset via emailed link, token valid 1h", "traces": ["FRD-1", "C1"], "taxonomy": ["functional", "security_authz"], "acceptance": "Requesting a reset emails a link that logs the user in once within 1h and is rejected after." },
  { "id": "BR-2", "text": "Paginated order history (20/page)", "traces": ["FRD-2", "C2"], "taxonomy": ["functional"], "acceptance": "Order history returns 20 items/page with working next/prev." }
]
```

Each BR entry carries an `acceptance` postcondition — an observable end-state the evaluator can verify, not a restatement of the requirement. This gives downstream gates (and any autonomous merge) a concrete pass/fail oracle instead of a self-judged "looks done".

Each BR entry also carries `taxonomy` — one or more of the ten slots Step 4.45 checks. Tag by what the requirement *is*, not by which section it came from; one requirement may legitimately carry several tags (an authenticated endpoint is both `functional` and `security_authz`).

**Also write `specs/brd/brd-acceptance.json`** — the postconditions split into individually traceable ids, one per observable claim:

```json
[
  { "id": "BR-1-AC1", "requirement": "BR-1", "text": "A reset request emails a link that logs the user in exactly once" },
  { "id": "BR-1-AC2", "requirement": "BR-1", "text": "A reset link is rejected after 1 hour" }
]
```

A prose `acceptance` sentence usually bundles two or three separate claims, and a story can satisfy one while silently dropping another. Splitting them is what lets `/spec` Step 6.46 prove coverage at criterion granularity instead of at requirement granularity.

**And write `specs/brd/brd-safeguards.json`** — the non-negotiable boundaries the design must honour, a superset of the Forbidden Actions list:

```json
[
  { "id": "SG-1", "kind": "invariant", "text": "An order total always equals the sum of its line items", "traces": ["FRD-3"] },
  { "id": "SG-2", "kind": "prohibition", "text": "Must not store raw passwords", "traces": ["C4"] },
  { "id": "SG-3", "kind": "limit", "text": "p95 checkout latency stays under 400ms", "traces": ["FRD-7"] }
]
```

`kind` is `invariant` | `prohibition` | `limit` | `norm`. These become required trace targets for the REASONS Canvas `Safeguards` and `Norms` sections at `/design`, so a business constraint cannot quietly fail to reach the design contract.
**Every BR entry must carry at least one valid trace.** If you cannot trace a requirement to an FRD section or a clarification, it is invented — either remove it, or (if the human genuinely wants it) capture the human's confirmation as a new `C-n` entry in `clarification-log.json` first, then trace to it. In interview-from-scratch mode (no FRD), trace BR entries to `INT-n` interview requirements and/or `C-n` clarifications; every `INT-n` must be covered by at least one BR entry.

Create the `specs/brd/` directory if it does not exist.

### Step 4.4 — Grounding Gate [HARD BLOCK — all modes]

Run the deterministic grounding check before the rubric evaluation — in FRD mode against the FRD spine, in interview mode against the confirmed interview spine. This proves mechanically — not by judgement — that the BRD invented and dropped nothing relative to the required spine (FRD or interview) + clarifications:

```bash
node .claude/skills/brd/scripts/grounding-check.js \
  --frd specs/brd/frd-requirements.json \
  --clarifications specs/brd/clarification-log.json \
  --brd specs/brd/brd-requirements.json \
  --out specs/reviews/brd-grounding.json
```

In interview-from-scratch mode, run the same gate with the interview spine as the required set (the verdict keeps the generic `frd_total`/`frd_covered` field names):

```bash
node .claude/skills/brd/scripts/grounding-check.js \
  --frd specs/brd/interview-requirements.json \
  --clarifications specs/brd/clarification-log.json \
  --brd specs/brd/brd-requirements.json \
  --out specs/reviews/brd-grounding.json
```

**Empty-spine guard (interview mode):** a verdict with `frd_total: 0` means `interview-requirements.json` is empty — the gate checked nothing. A completed five-dimension interview yields at least one `INT-n`; treat `frd_total: 0` as FAIL and return to Step 2 to capture the confirmed requirements before re-running.

The script writes `specs/reviews/brd-grounding.json` (`{ pass, frd_total, frd_covered, net_new[], dropped[] }`) and exits non-zero on any violation. **This is a hard gate, independent of the rubric score:**
- **`net_new` non-empty** → the BRD invented a requirement not in the FRD or any clarification. For each, either delete it or get explicit human sign-off and record it as a `C-n` clarification (then re-trace and re-run). Do **not** proceed with an unresolved net-new requirement.
- **`dropped` non-empty** → the BRD silently lost a required-spine requirement. Add a BR entry covering it (or, if the human confirms it is intentionally out of scope, record that decision as a `C-n` clarification noting the deferral) and re-run.

Only when `brd-grounding.json#pass === true` may you proceed to Step 4.5. (Skip only when neither `frd-requirements.json` nor `interview-requirements.json` exists — a pre-spine legacy project — and note the skipped gate in the BRD summary. **If you conducted the Step 2 interview in this session, the spine MUST exist** — a missing spine is a Step 2 execution bug, not a legacy project: reconstruct `interview-requirements.json` from the confirmed dimension summaries and re-run the gate. The skip applies only to a pre-existing BRD you did not author in this session.)

### Step 4.45 — Requirement-Taxonomy Floor [HARD BLOCK — all modes]

The grounding gate proves the BRD invented and dropped nothing **relative to its source**. It cannot prove the source asked the right questions: if the FRD never mentions retention, authorization, or failure modes, the BRD is silent on them too and every check above still passes. Comprehensiveness then reduces to "all sections are non-empty", which is a formatting property.

```bash
node .claude/scripts/brd-taxonomy-check.js \
  --requirements specs/brd/brd-requirements.json \
  --coverage specs/brd/taxonomy-coverage.json \
  --out specs/reviews/brd-taxonomy.json
```

Every one of the ten slots — `functional`, `data_lifecycle`, `integration`, `performance`, `security_authz`, `privacy_retention`, `observability`, `operability_failure`, `ux_accessibility`, `constraints` — needs either a requirement tagged with it, or an entry in `specs/brd/taxonomy-coverage.json` recording why it does not apply:

```json
[{ "slot": "privacy_retention", "na_reason": "the system stores no personal data; all records are anonymised aggregates" }]
```

**A justification must be a real reason.** `"N/A"`, `"none"`, `"TBD"`, and anything under 25 characters are rejected — the gate exists to force the question to be *asked*, and a box-tick means it was not. The reason lands in a committed artifact precisely so a reviewer can disagree with it.

Resolve a failure at the source: a genuinely uncovered slot usually means the interview skipped a dimension. Return to Step 2, ask, capture the answer as a `C-n` clarification, and add the requirement — do not paper over it with an excuse.

**Pre-existing BRD (not authored in this session).** A spine written before this gate existed carries no `taxonomy` field at all, so every requirement reports `UNTAGGED`. That is a migration state, not a quality signal. Tag the existing requirements first — reading each one and assigning its slots is a mechanical pass over an artifact you already have — then re-run. Do **not** record blanket `na_reason` entries to clear it; that converts a one-time migration into a permanently false clean bill of health. If you authored the spine in this session, `UNTAGGED` is a Step 4 execution bug: go back and tag them.

### Step 4.5 — Phase Evaluation Gate

Spawn the `evaluator` agent (artifact mode) to validate the BRD before human review.

**Agent invocation:**

Spawn Agent with subagent_type="evaluator" and prompt:
- Phase: brd
- Artifact: the BRD file path (specs/brd/brd.md or specs/brd/feature-{name}.md)
- Upstream: in FRD mode, `specs/brd/source-frd.md` + `specs/brd/frd-requirements.json` + `specs/brd/clarification-log.json`; in interview mode, `specs/brd/interview-requirements.json` + `specs/brd/clarification-log.json`
- Grounding verdict: `specs/reviews/brd-grounding.json` in both modes (already PASS from Step 4.4 — the evaluator confirms the rubric's traceability criterion against it) (absent only for pre-spine legacy projects, where the gate was skipped and noted)
- Rubric: Read .claude/templates/phase-eval-rubrics.json, key "brd"
- Iteration: 1 (increment on retry)
- Previous score: null (or previous iteration's weighted_average)
- Write result to specs/reviews/phase-brd-eval.json

**Ratchet loop (max 3 iterations):**

1. If verdict is **PASS** — proceed to Step 5. Attach the eval summary (weighted average, any warnings).
2. If verdict is **FAIL** — revise the BRD to address ALL error-severity findings. Re-run the evaluator with incremented iteration and previous score.
3. **Ratchet rule:** weighted_average must be >= previous iteration's score. If it decreases, revert to the previous version and try a different revision approach.
4. After 3 iterations without PASS — present the best-scoring version to the human with all findings attached. Note: "Phase evaluator did not reach threshold after 3 iterations. Findings below require human judgment."

### Step 5 — Present for Human Approval

Display the BRD and ask: "Does this BRD accurately capture the requirements? Approve to proceed to `/spec`, or provide corrections."

## Gate

**Grounding gate — hard block (both modes).** `grounding-check.js` proves mechanically that the BRD invented nothing (`net_new`) and dropped nothing (`dropped`) relative to the FRD spine (FRD mode) or the confirmed interview spine (interview mode), plus clarifications. Any violation blocks before the rubric even runs, regardless of quality score — see Step 4.4.

**Taxonomy floor — hard block (both modes).** `brd-taxonomy-check.js` proves every one of the ten requirement slots is either covered by a tagged requirement or excused with a substantive, committed reason — the check the grounding gate structurally cannot make, since grounding is relative to a source that may itself be silent. See Step 4.45.

**Phase evaluation gate runs before human approval.** The evaluator agent (artifact mode) scores the BRD against 5 criteria (completeness, traceability, specificity, consistency, actionability). Threshold: average >= 7.0, all criteria >= 5. In both modes the traceability criterion is anchored to the grounding verdict, and the completeness criterion to the taxonomy verdict, rather than free judgement.

**Human approval is still required before proceeding to `/spec`.** The gates validate quality + grounding; the human validates intent.

Do not auto-advance. Wait for explicit approval or correction.

## Gotchas

- **Do not skip the interview.** Never generate a BRD from a single sentence of input.
- **Do not skip Dimension 2.5.** Alternatives must be explored and documented.
- **Avoid vague success metrics.** "Users are happy" is not a metric. Push for numbers.
- **Check existing code first.** Proposing a new auth system when one already exists wastes cycles.
- **Confirm each dimension before moving on.** Misunderstood requirements compound.
- **Do not conflate MVP with the full product.** MVP is the smallest deployable slice.
