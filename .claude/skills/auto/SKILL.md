# Auto Skill

Autonomous build loop implementing Karpathy's ratcheting pattern with GAN-style generator-evaluator separation, agent teams for parallel execution, sprint contracts for verifiable done-criteria, self-healing with failure-driven learning, and session chaining for multi-context-window builds.

> **Ultracode tip:** Leave ultracode **off** here (`/effort high` or lower). This loop already orchestrates its own agent teams and generator↔evaluator fan-out against sprint contracts; ultracode's auto-workflows would double-orchestrate, fight the contracts, and burn tokens. Do the divergent thinking earlier (`/brownfield`, `/design`, `/spec`) with ultracode on, then turn it off before running `/auto`.

## Progressive loading (Phase 4)

This skill is an **orchestrator index**. Load only the section file for the step you are executing — do not read every reference up front.

### How to use

1. Parse flags and confirm prerequisites from **SECTION 1** (`references/section-1-1-usage-prerequisites-and-agent-delegation.md`).
2. Each iteration: SECTION 2 → 3 → 4/(4B) → 5 → 6 → … as needed.
3. On stop/budget/done: SECTION 10–12.
4. Wiring contract tests scan this file **and** `references/*.md` as one corpus.

### Load-bearing gate names (always visible here for harness integrity)

Gate 4 / pre-merge must continue to invoke: `cycle-gate.js`, `coupling-gate.js`, `mutation-gate.js` / mutation-smoke, `regression-gate.js` (with `--replay`, booting the app-under-test under `HARNESS_TEST_REPLAY=1` so its DB/HTTP/LLM resolve to the recorded boundary-doubles and a missing fixture is a hard fail), `contract-accessibility-default.js` as specified in the section files. Full procedure lives in the references.
