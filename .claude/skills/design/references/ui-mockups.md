# UI Mockup Reference

Read by the `generator` agent during the `/design` mockup step (Agent 2). Produce interactive HTML mockups during the design phase, before the generator writes production code. These mockups are the visual contract between design and implementation — the generator and evaluator both reference them.

## Inputs

- Ready user stories in `specs/stories/E{n}-S{n}.md` (focus on stories with layer: `UI`)
- API contracts in `specs/design/api-contracts.md` and `specs/design/api-contracts.schema.json`
- Architecture document in `specs/design/architecture.md`
- Project manifest in `project-manifest.json` (for brand colors, fonts, design tokens if defined)
- Aesthetic direction from the `frontend-design` skill (invoke before writing any mockup)

## Outputs

All mockups go to `specs/design/mockups/`. One HTML file per story or per screen:

```
specs/design/mockups/
  S-001-login.html
  S-002-dashboard.html
  S-003-user-profile.html
  index.html          (navigation index linking to all mockups)
```

## Mockup Requirements

### Technical
- **Self-contained HTML:** A single `.html` file that works when opened directly in a browser. No local imports, no build step required.
- **CDN-based React + Tailwind:** Load React from `unpkg.com` (or equivalent CDN), load Tailwind CSS from the CDN. No npm, no bundler.
- **No external API calls:** Use hardcoded realistic data that matches the shape defined in `api-contracts.schema.json`. Do not call `localhost` — the backend does not exist yet.

### Visual Quality
- **Aesthetic direction:** Invoke the `frontend-design` skill first and commit to a distinctive, intentional aesthetic (brutalist, editorial, retro-futuristic, luxury-minimal, etc.). Avoid raw Tailwind defaults — the `design-critic` scores those 1–3 on Originality.
- **Distinctive typography:** Pair a characterful display font with a refined body font. Do not use Inter/Roboto/Arial/system defaults.
- **Realistic data:** Use plausible names, emails, dates, and values — not "Lorem ipsum" or "test@test.com"
- **Responsive layout:** Must render correctly at 375px (mobile) and 1280px (desktop) widths
- **Interactive states:** Implement at least the primary user interaction for each story (form submission, navigation, toggle, etc.) using JavaScript within the HTML file
- **Accessible markup:** Use semantic HTML elements (`<nav>`, `<main>`, `<form>`, `<button>`), ARIA labels where needed, sufficient color contrast

### Data Fidelity
- Every field displayed in the mockup must correspond to a field in the API contract schema
- If the mockup shows data that is not in the schema, flag it as a schema gap in a comment at the top of the file
- Use the exact field names from the schema in data attributes or JavaScript variable names (not display labels)

## Quality Checklist

Before writing each mockup file, verify:

- [ ] HTML file is self-contained and opens without errors in a browser
- [ ] React and Tailwind are loaded from CDN (not local files)
- [ ] All displayed data fields exist in `api-contracts.schema.json`
- [ ] Realistic data is used (not placeholder text)
- [ ] Primary user interaction is implemented (not just a static screenshot)
- [ ] Layout is responsive (checked at 375px and 1280px)
- [ ] Semantic HTML elements are used throughout
- [ ] Color contrast meets WCAG AA (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text)
- [ ] Mockup is linked from `specs/design/mockups/index.html`

## Workflow

### Step 1: Read Inputs
- Read all frontend stories to understand what screens are needed
- Read API contracts to understand data shapes
- Read project-manifest.json for any design tokens (brand colors, fonts)
- Invoke the `frontend-design` skill to establish an aesthetic direction for the project. Capture the chosen direction (typography pair, color commitment, tone, spatial language) in `specs/design/mockups/aesthetic-direction.md` so every mockup and later production code can reference the same visual contract.

### Step 2: Plan Screen Inventory
- List each distinct screen or component that needs a mockup
- Map each screen to its story IDs and API endpoints
- Create the plan before writing any HTML

### Step 3: Build Mockups
- Write one mockup per screen
- Start with structure and data, then apply Tailwind styling
- Implement the primary interaction with vanilla JavaScript or React state

### Step 4: Build Index
- Create `specs/design/mockups/index.html` with links to all mockups
- Include: story ID, screen name, and the API endpoints it depends on

### Step 5: Validate
- Run each mockup through the quality checklist
- Fix any issues before marking the design phase complete

## Gotchas

**CDN availability:** Use versioned CDN URLs to avoid breaking changes (e.g., `https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.production.min.js`).

**Schema drift:** If the story requires data fields that are not in the API contract schema, document the gap. Do not silently add fields to the mockup — raise the discrepancy so the planner can update the schema.

**Scope fidelity:** Mockups must reflect the scope of the story, not invented features. If the story says "list view," the *information architecture* stays a list — but the *visual execution* should be distinctive and committed to the aesthetic direction. Bold aesthetic ≠ scope creep. Do not invent filtering, sorting, or data that is not in the story's acceptance criteria.

**Interactive fidelity:** Interactions should demonstrate the user flow, not implement business logic. Form validation can show error states; it does not need to actually validate email formats.
